# Logger
Project to create the log file.

  Often while developing applications, it becomes necessary to use the log file which comprises all the information and errors.
Having the information about the things which did not go well or which has crashed the application, it becomes easier to quickly fix the bugs and trace the discrepancies.
  This project will demonstrate you how to integrate the log files with your application. All you need is log.h and log.cpp to be included in your application. Main.cpp will show you how the log functions 'SET_LOG_CONFIGURATION()' and 'WRITE_LOG()' are used.
  
  **Todo:**
  - [ ] Refract classes in more subtle way.
  - [ ] Make the project cross-platform.
  - [ ] Create COM based DLL for the project. [For windows only.]
  
  **Note:** Currently, this project is compatible with Windows only. I am willing to make it cross platform soon. Anyone who is interested in contributing has liberty to help.
